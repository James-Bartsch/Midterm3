Main Takeaways:
-Plot of Washington Wizards attempted shots separated by season 
- Contour lines represent how the density of the total attempted shots, including assists is distributed
- Blue heat map shows areas where shots were attempted but were unsuccessful
- White dots show successful shot locations
- Seasons 2001-02 to 2002-03: Majority of shots not in the restricted zone taken in short corners in 4 distinct regions
- Seasons 2003-04 to 2004-05: Majority of shots not in the restricted zone taken in short corners, more three-point shots attempted than in prior years
- Seasons 2005-06-2007-08: Majority of shots not in the restricted zone are spread across the court within the three-point boundary and outside of the free-throw line, more shots taken outside the three-point line 
- Seasons 2008-09 to 2010-11: Euro-stepping legalized, shots within the restricted spread further from the hoop, similar shots within the three-point line, far fewer shots taken beyond the three-point line
- Season 2011-12: Far fewer shots taken outside of the restricted zone
- Seasons 2012-13 to 2013-14: Majority of shots not in the restricted zone taken at the high post, high density of three point shot in two very dense regions in the wing
-In the 2014-15 season, many shots were taken near the high post in the short corner with an especially high success/miss rate near the baseline,
-From the 2015-16 to 2016-17 season, shots were spread out within the three-point boundary.
-From 2018-19 to 2021-22, most shots taken outside the restricted zone were attempted beyond the three-point boundary.


A More Detailed Analysis
-Each plot depicts the location of all shots attempted during that season by the Washington Wizards.
-The contour lines indicate the overall density of attempted shots, including assists, the blue heat map depicts the areas where unsuccessful shots were attempted, and the white dots indicate the location of each successful shot taken that season.
-Most shots and assists were attempted within the restricted area which is a radius of 4 feet located around the basket.
2001-02 to 2002-03: Of those shots not taken in the restricted zone, the majority were distributed in the short corners in 4 high density regions rather than throughout the length of the block.  A very low number of shots were attempted beyond the three-point line in the three-point range.
2003-04 to 2004-05: Of shots not in the restricted zone the majority were in the short corners but spread throughout the length of the block/ More three-point shots were attempted than in prior years specifically in two very dense regions in the Wing.
2005-06-2007-08: Of shots not in the restricted zone, the majority are spread across the court within the three-point boundary and outside of the free-throw lane, more shots are being taken outside the three-point line especially concentrated in the two "Wing" zones.
2008-09 to 2010-11: Euro-stepping introduced as a legal move and successful shots in the restricted zone can be seen to spread further from the hoop.  Apart from the restricted zone, these years display similar shot patterns within the three-point line as prior years but with far fewer shots taken beyond the three-point line. 
2011-12: Far fewer shots taken outside of the restricted zone, and far fewer shots taken in total.
2012-13 to 2013-14: Most shots not in the restricted zone are taken at the high post, there is a high density of three point shot shots taken in the corners.
2014-15: Shots taken within the three-point boundary are concentrated in the high post, and there is a large amount of high successful/missed ratio shots in the short corner near the baseline.
2015-16 to 2016-17: Within the three-point boundary shots are spread throughout, a higher number of shots are being attempted outwards beyond the three-point boundary. 
2018-19 to 2021-22: Most shots taken outside the restricted zone are now attempted outwards beyond the three-point boundary. The change in the shot-attempt-location distribution over the years could be evidence that: players are becoming more effective at making three-point shots, the penalty for missing shots is smaller now than in the early 2000s, the defensive abilities of opposing teams is improving forcing shots to be attempted further out, the defensive capabilities of  opposing teams are insufficient and non-three-point shot attempts are able to reach the restricted zone.â€ƒ
